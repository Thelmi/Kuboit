// initializing mlx using mlx int

// creating a window using mlx_new_window

// we intialize the player view and position

// to initialize player x in tile

(game->pl_x_tile =(game->pl_x * TILE_SIZE) + (TILE_SIZE / 2))

(game->pl_y_tile =(game->pl_y * TILE_SIZE) + (TILE_SIZE / 2))

Notes:  (TILE_SIZE / 2) means it will always start in the middle of the tile

side note: what we are doing here is called x window programming,
x window programming: graphical system for Unix
xpm: X PixMap is an image file format used by x window system

mlx_new_image() creates a new image in memory, it retuned void * needed to 
manipulte it later

mlx_get_data_addr() returns information about the created image,
allowing a user to modify it later.

bits_per_pixel will be filled with the number of bits needed to represent a pixel color

size_line is the number of bytes used to store one 
line of the image in memory. This information is needed 
to move from one line to another in the image.

endian tells you wether the pixel color in the image needs to be stored in:
little (endian == 0), or big (endian == 1).

important!! it returns the address of the first pixel
