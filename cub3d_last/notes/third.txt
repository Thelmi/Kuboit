// decision of the textures

if horizental shorter then if its going up then the ray will
be touching south side of the tile which means we will need the
south texture (sin > 0)

if its going down tho (sin < 0)
then it touching the north side of the tile

if the vertical ray is shorter one and it goes right
(cos > 0) so it touching west which means it needs the west texture
if it going west then it is touching east then we need east texture

and after the it returns the shorter ray,

now we need to make sure there is no fisheye... so we need to make all arrays
equal execpt the edges one we need to make them, relevent hight

game ->ray.ray_length_corrected = 
game->ray.ray_length * cos(game->ray_angle - game->pl_view_ang)
